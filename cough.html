        1]Add ½ teaspoon of turmeric in a glass of water and gargle. This will give relief in dry coughs.<br><br>
            2]Drink a glass of lukewarm water after adding ½ teaspoon ginger powder. This will add warmth and give
                relief in throat irritation.<br><br>
            3]Chew on a clove for 10-15 minutes for relief in throat congestion and irritation.<br><br>
            4]Rubbing the chest with slightly heated sesame oil is helpful. Add a little menthol to steaming water and
                inhale the steam. This will lighten the chest and help in expelling phlegm.<br><br>
            5]Toast 2 teaspoons of cumin in a pan. Wrap the cumin in a cotton handkerchief and inhale the aroma of the
                cumin. Reheat the cumin and do this a couple of times. Chewing the cumin can also help.
        </ul>
