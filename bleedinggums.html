       1] Triphala tea is very effective in treating bleeding gums and gingivitis. It has astringent properties
                and it is known to be haemostatic, that is, it stops the bleeding. Gargling and swishing the mouth with
                triphala tea are helpful for both the conditions.<br><br>
            2]Drink a glass of lemon water, which is also known to help stop the blood.<br><br>
            3]Raw apples are said to be beneficial. Eating a raw apple for about half an hour after meals helps to
                clean the teeth and heal the gums. You can eat pears too.<br><br>
            4]Try eating raspberries two to three times a day on an empty stomach. Make sure you do not combine them
                with a dairy product.<br><br>
