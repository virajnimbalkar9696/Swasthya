        1]Cloves
Keep a few pieces of cloves in your mouth and suck them for long. The aroma and taste of cloves can bring an immediate stop to vomiting. It brings about a change in the taste buds too. It also reduces the sensitivity of the mouth. Drink clove tea to avoid vomiting. Take one cup of boiling water and add one teaspoon of cloves. Steep for ten minutes, and strain before drinking. <br><br>
            2]Crush a piece of ginger (adrak) and put it in water. Add one teaspoon of honey to this and sip it the entire day. Ginger has qualities that can ease the irritation of the stomach and bring instant relief. Another best way of having ginger is by making a fresh ginger tea. Take one teaspoon of freshly-grated ginger root to one cup of boiling water. Steep for 10 minutes, and strain before drinking.<br><br>
            3]Since vomiting has the ability to lead to an imbalance of the various levels of salts in the body - these could be sodium, potassium, etc. - drinking a good mixture of sugar and salt in water has the potential to bring these levels into the normal range for effective functioning of the body. The solution will not allow the body to get dehydrated and would prevent weakness of the body. It acts as a natural electrol.

            4]Saunf
Also known as fennel, chewing saunf at regular intervals is extremely effective. It refreshes the taste of the mouth and makes the person feel much better. Have fennel tea to avoid vomiting. Take one teaspoon of fennel seeds and add one cup of boiling water. Steep for 10 minutes and strain before drinking.
