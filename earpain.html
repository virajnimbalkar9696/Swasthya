         1]Roast some dry turmeric in mustard oil, strain it and use it as ear drops. Apply a few drops of this oil
                into your ear and leave it overnight. Pus formation may stop in a fortnight causing improved hearing.<br><br>
            
            2]Extracting juice of mango leaves or neem leaves and using it as ear drops helps too. These drops are
                known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial effects. <br><br>
           3]Jatamansi and ashwagandha, the two most common ayurvedic herbs can be prepared together in the oil. You
                can use this daily in case of vertigo and tinnitus.<br><br>
            4]Five cloves of garlic crushed and boiled in coconut oil and applied as ear drops are another good option
                for treating ear infection and pain.<br><br>
           5]Few drops of Bhangra juice mixed with black tulsi poured in the affected ear can provide quick relief.
            <br><br>           6]Ayurveda also recommends avoiding cold and wind conditions while suffering from ear pain. It also
                recommends avoiding certain foods that aggravate Kapha like curd, banana, sour fruits.<br><br>
