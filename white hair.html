      <ul style="font-size: 20px;"style="text-align: center;">
        1]Heat 1 cup amla powder in an iron vessel until it turns into ash. Add 500ml coconut oil and simmer on a slow flame for 20 minutes. Let it cool and stand for 24 hours, and then strain the next day into an airtight bottle. Use this twice a week as a hair oil massage.
 <br><br>
            2]Take a bunch of curry leaves and grind them with 2 tsp amla powder and 2 tsp brahmi powder. Apply this as a hair mask on the hair, making sure to cover the roots. Leave on for an hour and rinse with a mild herbal shampoo.

            3]Indigo, or neel, as it is more commonly known, is a natural colourant used since ancient time to colour hair. It creates a bluish black colour and can be mixed with henna to cover grey areas, making the hair acquire a darker colour.

<br><br>
            4]Coconut oil and lemon juice mixed together can help darken the hair. The combination of these two causes a chemical reaction which darkens the hair naturally over a period of time. So make the most of it and get going.
