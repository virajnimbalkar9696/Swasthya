        1]A high intake of sodium (salt) is an excellent remedy to treat low blood pressure. High salt intake is closely associated with hypertension, therefore increasing your salt intake can stabilize your blood pressure when decreased. However, this increased intake should be of moderate quality. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), your daily diet must contain a teaspoon of added salt.

            2]By increasing, fluid intake can raise blood volume that helps increase blood pressure. It can also prevent dehydration which is the reason for low blood pressure. Also, water contains various minerals such as potassium that help regain normal pressure instantly. However, make sure that the blood pressure dropped due to loss of fluids before commencing the water therapy.

            3] Coffee and caffeinated drinks can raise your blood pressure temporarily. A cup of coffee can help as it increases blood pressure and boosts the heart rate. It causes a dramatic increase in your blood pressure though it is temporary.

            4]Green tea contains many antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that make it an option to treat low blood pressure. However, the exact mechanism is unknown but thought to inhibit the function of the hormone responsible for keeping your arteries dilated. Constricting the arteries raises blood pressure.
